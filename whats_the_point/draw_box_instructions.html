<p>Please draw a tight bounding box around one new instance of the specified object class. See the examples below to learn what is considered a good bounding box.</p>

<p>If there are yellow boxes on the image:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your box should not be around an object instance that already has a good yellow bounding box around it.
<li>The system will not let you draw a box too close to an existing box by giving a 'Too close to existing box' error. You will not be able to submit unless you fix this error.
<li>Some yellow boxes may be incorrect; simply ignore them.
</ul>

<p>Click the 'Click here if no box can be drawn' button if:</p>
<ol>
<li>The object is not present in the image, or
<li>The object is present but all instances are already correctly annotated by yellow boxes, or
<li>The only remaining unannotated instances are so close to existing yellow boxes that the system will not let you draw a box around them by giving a 'Too close to existing box' error.

</ol>
